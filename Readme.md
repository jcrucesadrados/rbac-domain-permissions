# üßôÔ∏è Orbit RBAC with domain permissions system
Orbit Permissions is a Laravel package that allows managing permissions according to the Role Based Access Control rules, adding an extra capability to constrain the permissions to a given domain.

This system allows assigning a role (with a set of policies or permissions) and constraining the actions to a given domain. For example, this system allows to say that a user is an admin for a given set of services, constraining the actions permitted by the policies to those services.
